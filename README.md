# FAIRER-Aware-Data-Checklist

Data checklists are a useful data management tool for data providers and for data repositories, as well as for data stewards and managers who need to approve data without having been involved in their production. The checklist is discipline-agnostic, making it relevant to any scientific field. The use of data checklists will help promote consistency, awareness, understanding, and efficiency in data governance.

The data checklists are not meant to be prescriptive, nor are they exhaustive. There is no "one-size-fits-all" or "off-the-shelf" solution. Organizations should adapt the questions to their particular needs-modifying, removing, or adding new ones where necessary-and, implementation should be incremental. This work should complement, not compete with machine-actionable Data Management Plans (maDMP's) or other open initiatives.

Implemented on the input side of a data repository data checklists are a critical component to help ensure FAIRER (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable, Ethical, and Reproducible) data and to maintain data quality, consistency, and transparency.
