# Interdisciplinary Research Data Management glossary (IRiDiuM)

IRiDiuM is an interdisciplinary glossary for research data management that has been developed to facilitate communication between diverse stakeholders working together in this area. The initial compilation from a variety of online sources was reviewed and refined by a wide range of vocabulary and domain specific experts. Community sourcing was used to refine the glossary.

The need for such a glossary emerged as an increasing number of new terms have come into use to refer to new concepts and as terms borrowed from other disciplines have been given new meaning. The aim is a stable glossary of community accepted definitions kept relevant by maintaining a 'living resource' that is updated when necessary.

IRiDiuM was originally developed by the Research Data Canada (RDC) Standards & Interoperability Committee (SINC) in partnership with the international Consortia Advancing Standards in Research Administration Information (CASRAI).
